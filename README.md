# Space_Engineers
My various Files for the Game Space Engineers (Beta)

The primary purpose of this Repo is to store the Optimized variants of the various Files that get used in the Game.

# Optimizations Include:
* Compacting Scripts where Possible
	* Inline Single Command
		* `If`
		* `Else If`
		* `Else`
	* Removing Blank Lines, Including Empty Lines filled with:
		* Tabs
		* Spaces
		* Nothing
	* Turning Space Indent into Tab Indent.
		* It's easier to Read, both for the User, and the Game (probably)
* Fixing any Errors I manage to Locate
* Adding any Features I can Think of
	* With plans on Sugestion to the Mod Author
		* Eg. Auto Helmet Mod:
			* Introduce Chat Command to alter Delay
			* Simplify Math for Delay (**`1 Line != 1 Math`**)
